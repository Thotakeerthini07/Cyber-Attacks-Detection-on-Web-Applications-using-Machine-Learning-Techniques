# Cyber Attacks Detection on Web Applications using Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to enhance the security of web applications by using Machine Learning algorithms to detect cyber attacks such as SQL Injection and Port Scans. It implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) trained on the CICIDS2017 dataset.

## üìå Project Objective

To detect cyber-attacks on web applications by analyzing user input and behavior using machine learning algorithms such as:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
